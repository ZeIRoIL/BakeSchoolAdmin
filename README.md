# BakeSchoolAdmin

## Instructions and documentation
These are located in the documentation folder. 

## Deploy
To build the programme, you need to host Docker locally.
The image is located in the repository. Load the image into your own Docker and run it.

In this image there must be a MongoDb with a database "LearnBakeDb" with two collections: 
"CategoryCollection"
"RecipeCollectin"

## In case of faults and errors
If errors occur in our programme, please try to restart the programme and be sure that the database is running in the background.
If the error still occurs, please contact our support. We will send a new update to the repository as soon as possible.
